	<h1>Building a backend from scratch using only OpenAI Codex</h1>

	<p>
		In the last few weeks, I and the rest of our team have been playing around a lot with OpenAI's
		Codex Model, as we've incorporated it into our latest feature (<a href="/suggester">
			the suggester</a
		>), and we've been generally impressed by it's performance.
	</p>

	<p class="border-l-4 border-blue-600 py-2 pl-4">
		"OpenAI Codex is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It parses natural
		language and generates code in response. It is used to power GitHub Copilot, a programming
		autocompletion tool developed for Visual Studio Code. Codex is a descendant of OpenAI's GPT-3
		model, fine-tuned for use in programming applications."
	</p>

	<p>
		I had the idea of a challenge for myself: Create something useful, from scratch, using only
		Codex.
	</p>

	<p>
		My goal was to create a backend for a TodoMVC-style app. In our case, it will be a backend for a
		tasklist with tasks that can be added, listed, and marked as completed. The frontend is to be
		built manually (in SvelteKit).
	</p>

	<div class="inline-flex flex-col items-center">
		<img src="/todo-mvc.png" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
		<i>Screenshot of the final application, once completed</i>
	</div>

	<p>
		First, I tried to create the backend in Go, but Codex continuously messed up the syntax when
		inserting new code, and usually ended up adding a new function withing another one (syntax
		error!)
	</p>
	<p>
		I switched strategy, and attempted to generate a Python app instead, and it worked great. The
		continuation of this blog post is a series of prompts used, together with comments about what
		worked and what didn't end up working out.
	</p>

	<p>
		I ended up using the "Codex" in the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-edit-insert/"
			>"edit" mode</a
		> as it makes the prompt design easier. The edit mode takes two inputs, a file and a instruction/prompt,
		and spits out a new version of the input file. For the input file, I started with an empty file,
		and for later prompts the output of the previous step was used.
	</p>

	<p>Here we go! First prompt:</p>
</div>

<div class="relative space-y-16 p-4 lg:space-y-32">
	{#each steps as step}
		<Step prompt={step.prompt} code={step.code} added={step.addedLines} comment={step.comment} />
	{/each}
</div>

<div class="prose">
	<p>
		That's it, our backend is done! You can check it out, and use the frontend at <a
			href="https://todo.codeball.ai/">todo.codeball.ai</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Developing with Codex is a bit special, and it sometimes takes a few attempts to get it to write <i
			>exactly</i
		>
		what you want it to. But in broad strokes, getting from nothing to <i>something</i> in just
		<strong>10 prompts</strong> is really impressive and encouraging.
	</p>
	<p>
		Codex continues to amaze me, and I'm sure that this task could be done in fewer steps (maybe
		even one?) with some <i>prompt engineering</i>. I'd like to start a <strong>prompt golf</strong>
		challenge! If you have access to Codex, can you re-create this backend in fewer steps? As few characters
		as possible?
	</p>
	<p>
		Would be cool to see how far we can take this, looking forward to hear in the comments on <a
